  <h1>Research Areas</h1>

  <h2>Modeling, Simulation & AI‑Driven Process Development</h2>
  <p>
    My research is anchored in the development of advanced computational models that describe and optimize 
    complex chemical processes. I integrate reaction kinetics, transport phenomena, and multi‑phase behavior 
    into predictive frameworks that support reactor design, process intensification, and scale‑up.
  </p>

  <p>
    I build mechanistic and hybrid models using Python, MATLAB, and custom simulation tools, combining 
    first‑principles modeling with data‑driven approaches. Increasingly, I incorporate machine learning and 
    AI‑assisted optimization to accelerate catalyst discovery, improve parameter estimation, and guide 
    experimental planning. These tools enhance predictive accuracy and enable faster, more informed 
    decision‑making in industrial process development.
  </p>

  <h2>Hydrothermal & Thermochemical Conversion</h2>
  <p>
    I investigate hydrothermal and thermochemical pathways for converting biomass, plastics, and waste 
    materials into clean fuels and value‑added chemicals. My work spans sub‑critical and supercritical water 
    environments, focusing on reaction mechanisms, catalyst performance, and process optimization.
  </p>

  <p>
    My publications include studies on hydrothermal gasification, catalytic upcycling of end‑of‑life plastics, 
    tar mitigation strategies, and the development of validated gasifier models. This research supports 
    circular‑economy solutions and low‑carbon energy technologies.
  </p>

  <h2>Advanced Materials & Catalysis</h2>
  <p>
    I explore structure–property relationships that govern catalytic activity and stability in processes such 
    as CO₂ conversion, methane reforming, and hydrothermal upgrading. My work includes catalyst synthesis, 
    performance evaluation, and advanced characterization using GC‑MS, HPLC, TGA, BET, XRD, and related 
    techniques.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recent efforts focus on catalysts for CO₂ hydrogenation, syngas production, and the hydrothermal 
    conversion of complex waste streams, contributing to more efficient and sustainable chemical processes.
  </p>

  <h2>Clean‑Energy Systems & Industrial Applications</h2>
  <p>
    I collaborate with industry, government, and academic partners to translate scientific insights into 
    practical engineering solutions. My applied research includes reactor design, process intensification, 
    techno‑economic assessment, and the development of scalable technologies for hydrogen production, 
    waste‑to‑energy systems, and carbon‑neutral fuels.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through multidisciplinary projects, I help bridge the gap between laboratory research and industrial 
    deployment, ensuring that emerging technologies are safe, efficient, and commercially viable.
