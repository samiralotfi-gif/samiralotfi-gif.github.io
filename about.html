  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I am a researcher with more than 15 years of experience advancing clean‑energy technologies, thermochemical 
    conversion, catalysis, and process modeling. I hold a PhD in Chemical Engineering from École Polytechnique 
    de Montréal and have spent the past decade as a Research Officer at the National Research Council of Canada, 
    where I lead multidisciplinary R&amp;D programs at the intersection of materials, energy, and industrial innovation.
  </p>

  <p>
    My work focuses on developing advanced chemical processes and predictive modeling frameworks that bridge 
    fundamental science with applied engineering. I have contributed to peer‑reviewed publications, patents, 
    and collaborative research initiatives across academia, government, and industry. My research spans hydrogen 
    production, CO₂ conversion, biomass valorization, and waste‑to‑energy technologies, with a strong emphasis on 
    reactor development, kinetic modeling, and catalyst design.
  </p>

  <p>
    I bring extensive experience in experimental design and advanced analytical techniques (GC‑MS, HPLC, TGA, 
    BET, XRD, and more), along with a proven track record managing complex research programs, supervising teams, 
    and coordinating multi‑institutional collaborations. My work increasingly integrates artificial intelligence 
    to optimize processes and accelerate catalyst development.
  </p>

  <p>
    Committed to safe and effective laboratory practice, I am skilled in hazard prevention, safety management, 
    and regulatory compliance. I also enjoy teaching, mentoring, and sharing research outcomes through scientific 
    presentations and conferences.
